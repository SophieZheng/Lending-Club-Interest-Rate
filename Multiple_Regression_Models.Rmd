```{r, echo=FALSE}

#Loans_path <- file.path(getwd(), "LoanStats3a.csv")
#Loans_path

dir = "/Users/SophieZheng/Google Drive/Stats Project"
setwd(dir)

library(readxl)
#library(readr)
#library("data.table")

#Loan <- read.csv(file="loan_10000_new.csv",head=TRUE,sep=",")
Loan <- read_excel("LoanStats3b.xlsx",col_names = TRUE)

# Empty columns contain NAs only or ""s only, they have has no variability. This code removes all columns without variability (which is probably a plus in this case).
Loan <- Loan[!sapply(Loan, function(var) (length(unique(var)) == 1))]

Loan <- na.omit(Loan)

# Get first 2000 rows
#Loan <- Loan[c(1:2000),]

# Remove 'xx' from zip code end
Loan$zip_new <- gsub("xx","",Loan$zip_code)

```

# Model 1

```{r}

model <- lm(formula= int_rate ~  loan_amnt + revol_util + dti + tot_cur_bal + tot_hi_cred_lim + home_ownership + total_bc_limit + term + percent_bc_gt_75 + purpose + installment, data = Loan)

summary(model)

```

Testing the assumptions

home_ownership, term and purpose are categorical string variables
Hence removed those in checks for collinearity

```{r}

pairs(~int_rate + loan_amnt + revol_util + dti + tot_cur_bal + tot_hi_cred_lim + total_bc_limit + installment + percent_bc_gt_75, data = Loan)

cor(Loan[,c("loan_amnt","revol_util","dti","tot_cur_bal","tot_hi_cred_lim","total_bc_limit","installment")])

```

'tot_cur_bal' is highly collinear with 'tot_hi_cred_lim'

Hence removing 'tot_cur_bal' (Since it has higher p-value among both).

'Installment' is highly collinear with 'loan_amnt' so removing installment as well.
Plus installment does not make logical sense since it is derived in part from interest rate.

# Model 2

```{r}

Loan$homeF <- factor(Loan$home_ownership)
Loan <- within(Loan,homeF <- relevel(homeF, ref="NONE"))

model <- lm(formula= int_rate ~  loan_amnt + revol_util + dti + tot_hi_cred_lim + homeF + total_bc_limit + term + percent_bc_gt_75 + purpose, data = Loan)

summary(model)

```

Check for Standardized residuals

```{r}

model.stres <- rstandard(model)
plot(model$fitted.values, model.stres, pch = 16, main = "Standardized Residual Plot", xlab = "Fitted Interest Rate", ylab = "Standardized Residuals")
abline(0,0, lty=2, col="red")

```

Check for normality 

```{r}

h <- hist(model.stres)
# x <- model.stres
# xfit <- seq(min(x), max(x), length = 50)
# yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x))
# yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(x)
# lines(xfit, yfit, col="blue")

qqnorm(model.stres)
qqline(model.stres,col="red")

shapiro.test(model.stres)

```

# Model 3

After changing home_ownership to factors the other variables become insignificant. 
Removing home_ownership.

```{r}

Loan$homeF <- factor(Loan$home_ownership)
Loan <- within(Loan,homeF <- relevel(homeF, ref="NONE"))

model <- lm(formula= int_rate ~  loan_amnt + revol_util + dti + tot_hi_cred_lim +  total_bc_limit + term + percent_bc_gt_75 + purpose, data = Loan)

summary(model)

```

# Model 4

Removing purpose as many of the variables are insignificant.
loan_amnt becomes insignificant in the above model. 
Since the scale is too high. Taking log of loan_amnt and using it in the model.

```{r}

model <- lm(formula= int_rate ~  log(loan_amnt) + revol_util + dti + tot_hi_cred_lim +  total_bc_limit + term + percent_bc_gt_75, data = Loan)

summary(model)

```

# Model 5

```{r}

attach(Loan)

model <- lm(formula= int_rate ~  log(loan_amnt) + revol_util + dti + tot_hi_cred_lim +  total_bc_limit + term + percent_bc_gt_75, data = Loan)

summary(model)

```

# Model 6

```{r}
attach(Loan)
Loan$purposeF = factor(Loan$purpose)
Loan = within(Loan, purposeF<-relevel(purposeF,ref="credit_card"))
              
model6 <- lm(formula= int_rate ~  log(loan_amnt) + revol_util + dti + log(tot_hi_cred_lim) +  log(total_bc_limit) + term +percent_bc_gt_75+purposeF, data = Loan)

summary(model6)
```
